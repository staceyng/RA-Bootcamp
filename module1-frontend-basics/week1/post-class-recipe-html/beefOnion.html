  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 pound of beef</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of cornstarch</li>

    </ul>
  <h2>Intructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Follow the directions of the Spaghetti (16 oz) package for al dente pasta, but subtract 1-2 minutes from what they
    suggest. We will be cooking this again in a frying pan so we want to under-cook the pasta.</li>
    <li>Once the noodles are done, pour in into a strainer and lightly rinse off the extra starch and set aside.</li>
    <li>Cut the Onion (1) in half, then and slice them into thin half moon slices and set aside.</li>
    <li>Combine the Dark Soy Sauce (1 1/2 Tbsp) , Soy Sauce (1/3 cup) , and Granulated Sugar (1 Tbsp) into 1 bowl and set aside.</li>
    <li>Cut the Beef (1.1 lb) thinly against the grain and put it into a bowl.</li>
    <li>Marinate the beef with 2-3 teaspoons of the soy sauce mixture from step 2 and Corn Starch (1 tsp) for 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add in the onions and cook it for 3 minutes until soft and golden.</li>
    <li>Add in the beef and cook for 3-5 minutes until it looks done.</li>
    <li>Add in the spaghettini and then add the sauce mixture on top of everything and cook for 2-3 minutes until everything is
    nice and brown and evenly mixed. Serve and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Total prep time : 15 minutes</p>
