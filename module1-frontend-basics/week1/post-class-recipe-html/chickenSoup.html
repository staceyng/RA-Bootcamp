  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Makes 6 servings</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, chicken fat or olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 large carrots, chopped</li>
      <li>2 stalks celery, chopped (optional)</li>
      <li>Heaped tablespoon minced garlic (4 cloves)</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs (4 or 5 thighs)</li>
      <li>8 cups chicken stock or broth</li>
      <li>5 ounces egg noodles (or pasta of choice)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
      <li>Water or more stock, as needed</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Intructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Melt butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring every few
    minutes until the vegetables begin to soften; 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in the garlic, bay leaves, and thyme. Cook, while stirring the garlic around the pan, for about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a low simmer. Taste the soup then adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.
    Depending on the stock used, you might need to add 1 or more teaspoons of salt.</li>
    <li>Submerge the chicken thighs into the soup so that the broth covers them. Bring the soup back to a low simmer then
    partially cover the pot with a lid and cook, stirring a few times until the chicken thighs are cooked through; about 20
    minutes.</li>
    <li>If, during this time, the broth seems low, add a splash more stock or a bit of water. Turn the heat to medium-low.</li>
    <li>Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate. Stir the noodles into the soup and cook until done, 6 to 10 minutes depending on
    the type of noodles used.</li>
    <li>While the noodles cook, shred the chicken into strips or dice into cubes. Slide the chicken back into the pot and then
    taste the soup once more for seasoning. Adjust with more salt and pepper, as needed. Stir in the parsley and serve.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Total prep time : 40 minutes</p>
